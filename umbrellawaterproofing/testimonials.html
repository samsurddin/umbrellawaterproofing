                            <p class="font">In February of 2010, the Hamptons on Issaquah Ridge undertook a major repair effort to correct original construction defects in our 64-unit townhome complex. After reviewing bids from other contractors, and at the advice of our design firm, We chose Umbrella Construction as our General Contractor. During the course of the project, | acted as the construction liaison, working with our Board, homeowners, Umbrella and our design firm. Yuri Kozodoy from Umbrella and his crew were great to work with from beginning to end.<br><br>Prior to the start of the construction, Umbrella took the time to completely understand the project and specifications during the bid process. Once we signed the contract with them, within only 3 days ,Umbrella was able to provide a construction schedule, mobilize a crew, and begin work. During the construction, weather played a significant role in delaying some aspects of the work, but Umbrella was very nimble in adjusting the workers to address other items of the project which were not affected by the Weather in order to keep the schedule on-track.<br><br>As the project ramped up, it quickly became clear that Umbrella was not there just to complete a job, but to ensure that we, as a community, were happy with both the process and the end result. Below are a few examples. <br><br>Work was performed at each of 64 decks that required homeowners to remove their personal belongings. Some homeowners had particular difficulties with Satellite Dishes and other items. While clearly out of the scope of their contract, Umbrella provided extra coordination and effort where special conditions existed and where homeowners were out of ln a few situations,their workers (with our permission) actually moved homeowner deck furniture and other itemsdown ladders from the second story decks by hand, and then replace them when the work was complete.<br><br>~ Some homeowners found fault with existing items that were in the vicinity of the work performed, but not part of the original project. Umbrella took the time to address homeowner concerns thoroughly, remained patient, and made adjustments where possible to satisfy the owners. <br><br>The construction crew was mature, very polite and accommodating. We had very positive comments from some of the homeowners regarding the crew such as: “They're like army ants, always working come rain or shine” and “they are very meticulous and hardworking.” They treated our property and homeowners with respect and clearly cared about the results of their work.<br><br>There is one area where Umbrella was particularly impressive: when there were questions whether a concern was reasonable or Within the scope of repair, Umbrella would waiver in favor of the Association. For example, while Umbrella followed the specifications of our original design, Some of the specs resulted in a less then desired aesthetic result. Instead of holding us strictly to the contract, Umbrella was able to make adjustments after-the-fact to satisfy us at no additional cost to the Association. <br><br>Also, during the project, some other small items were found by Umbrella that needed to be addressed but were clearly out of the scope of the project. They took care of these for us as a courtesy at no additional cost, I highly recommend Umbrella. They were quick and nimble, cost effective, cooperative, and did a great job completing our r`eRair project.</p>

                            <p class="font">To Whom It May Concern:<br><br>As president of the Le Chateau Condominiums homeowner’s association, I would like to take the time to emphasize a few specific reasons why one might consider the Umbrella Company for repairs to improve house, apartment, or condominium. During the entire investigation and reparation project (2007-2008)of Le Chateau’s decks , Umbrella’s management team and its labor force have demonstrated their skillful competence and effective communication skills. Examples of this competence follow.<br><br>Firstly, Umbrella’s construction manager, Mr. Gennady Kozodoy, is a true professional in his industry; a professionalism demonstrated throughout the entire deck repair project at Le Chateau condominiums. Moreover, this professionalism was greatly enhanced by excellent communication, work ethic, and his desire to ensure our homeowners’ satisfaction with their work. Homeowners had easy access to Mr.Kozodoy, who responded quickly and effectively to address and resolve any and all concerns; and as a result, the board was left with very little to concern themselves throughout our business relationship.<br><br>Punctual and prepared for our scheduled meetings, Umbrella’s manager took their time to fully address our concerns, insuring that we fully understood and were satisfied with the answers and solutions. He always carried out the objectives set forth and agreed upon by both parties to the best of his ability, and has always accepted to take on the issues confronted, whether related to the scope or not, as a true professional. This manager seemed fully competent in the understanding of the exterior envelope systems of our building and communicated well this knowledge to us laymen. One could readily see that he is passionate towards and takes pride in the work he accomplished.<br><br>Lastly, Mr. Kozodoy, and his construction team demonstrated their commitment to and care for their clients, not only through their very polite and respectful demeanor, but also by going above and beyond in accommodating some of our homeowners with individual issues. One example was the installation of safety bars in the bathroom of one of our senior citizens, at no charge. They truly do care about their relationship with their clients. In addition, Umbrella Company took to the task of writing up and providing Le Chateau homeowners with a personalized, comprehensive maintenance protocol of the decks and siding to ensure that owners know how to keep their decks and siding in good condition and thus, keep the product warranty intact.<br><br>All in all, it has been an easy pleasure to work with the Umbrella Company and its manager, and we at Le Chateau are pleased with their workmanship and the business relationship that we have developed with Umbrella. We look forward to maintaining this relationship, and have planned to hire Umbrella for any future repair work we may need. I am confident that anyone using Umbrella’s services will be completely satisfied with their workmanship and professionalism, as we were, and will want to continue their relationship with Umbrella in resolving any future issues that may arise.</p>

                            <p class="font">Dear Yuri,<br><br>The Eastwood Villa Homeowners want to thank you and your crew for all of the hard work put into the repair of our condo building! After spending over four years in a stressful lawsuit, we did not get the amount of money we expected and needed to fully fix our building. We had to tailor our repairs to fit our budget. It wasn’t just the competitive bid that Umbrella offered, but the ability to pare down the scope of repair to fit our needs. Umbrella provided an expanse of expertise and knowledge of building defects.<br><br>Working with Umbrella was a great experience! From the time we signed the contract, everything went smoothly. I always felt your communication was given in a timely manner. I appreciated the amount of contact we were in to make sure we were on the same page and the needs of both parties were being met during the construction. Your professionalism was top notch and very appreciated. You are very ethical and run your business with a high degree of integrity. We were very pleased to receive a free upgrade to interior window encasings as a result of your integrity and dedication to the project.<br><br>We were all impressed with your crew. They were prompt to work each day, kept a clean work area and respected the owner’s personal space. When asked a question the Project Manager walked me through the answer making sure I understood.<br><br>I would highly recommend Umbrella Construction for any building that needs repair to a healthy condition. Eastwood Villa will call on you in the future to bid on the remaining projects we have and to maintain the work you have done for us this far.<br><br>Thanks again!</p>
